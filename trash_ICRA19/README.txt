This dataset was developed between March 2017 and August 2018. It is no longer the primary trash dataset, please use the updated version (https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/214865) .


The cfgs_and_weights folder contains configuration and weights files for the YOLO and TinyYOLO networks tested in the associated paper.

The dataset folder contains the dataset, split into train/test/val sets, and some testing videos just for visual examples. 

Most subfolders have a README file explaining their contents in more depth.
